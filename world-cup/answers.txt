Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

France rose as a result of raising the number of simulations, while Russia and Japan appeared at the end. Croatia and Spain also rose.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 100000 simulations, we go past one second, so the appropriate N would be 100000, which, in fact, takes less than one second. .
